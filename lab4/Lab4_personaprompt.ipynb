            "- Implement a password reset flow that starts with a user-initiated request, verified through an email or SMS sent to the registered contact information.\n",
            "- Use a token-based system for password reset links, ensuring the token is time-limited and single-use.\n",
            "- Require the user to provide the original password or answer security questions (if previously set) before allowing the password reset process to proceed.\n",
            "- Enforce a strong password policy for the new password, including requirements for length, complexity, and uniqueness.\n",

            "- Password reset requests return a confirmation message without revealing whether the account exists\n",
            "- Reset links expire after a reasonable time frame (e.g., 30 minutes) and can only be used once\n",
            "- New passwords must meet the defined strength criteria (length, mix of characters, etc.)\n",
            "- Successful password resets trigger a notification to the user (e.g., via email) and log the event for security auditing\n",
            "- Failed password reset attempts are logged and may trigger additional security measures (e.g., temporary account lockout) after a certain number of attempts\n",

            "To design a complete Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for a company internal FAQ chatbot, we need to consider the key components of such a system. This includes a robust question retrieval mechanism, an effective passage retrieval component, and a generation model that can synthesize the retrieved information into coherent and relevant answers. The pipeline should also incorporate a feedback loop for continuous improvement.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Final Answer**: \n",
            "1. **Question Retrieval**: Implement a dense passage retriever (DPR) to fetch relevant questions from the FAQ database based on employee queries.\n",
            "2. **Passage Retrieval**: Utilize a passage retrieval mechanism, such as a BM25 or DPR, to retrieve relevant passages from a knowledge base that contains detailed information related to the FAQs.\n",
            "3. **Generation Model**: Employ a sequence-to-sequence model, like BART or T5, fine-tuned on the company's internal data to generate answers based on the retrieved passages.\n",
            "4. **Ranking and Filtering**: Implement a ranking mechanism to prioritize generated answers based on relevance and a filtering system to remove redundant or low-quality answers.\n",
            "5. **Feedback Loop**: Develop a feedback mechanism that allows employees to rate the quality of the answers provided by the chatbot, which can be used to fine-tune the models over time.\n",
            "6. **Knowledge Base Updates**: Regularly update the knowledge base with new information and retrain the models as necessary to ensure the chatbot remains accurate and helpful.\n",
