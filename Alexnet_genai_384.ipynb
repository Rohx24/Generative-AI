Each neuron receives inputs, processes them, and outputs a result to other connected neurons, with the network as a whole learning and adapting to its environment through trial and error. This process enables the network to recognize patterns and make informed decisions on its own, with applications in image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and more.\n"
